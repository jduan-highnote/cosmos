// Rust lets you borrow a reference to the value of any sort of expression at all.

// some struct or array that is being immediately assigned), then Rust makes the anonymous
// variable live as long as the variable the let initializes. In the example below, Rust
// would do this for the referent of r.

// Since STASH lives for the program’s entire execution, the reference type it holds must have a
// lifetime of the same length; Rust calls this the 'static lifetime. But the lifetime of p’s
// reference is some 'a, which could be anything, as long as it encloses the call to f. So, Rust

// This time, the function's signature spells out that p must be a reference with lifetime 'static,

//
// Take a step back, though, and notice what happened to f’s signature as we amended our way to
// correctness: the original f(p: &i32) ended up as f(p: &'static i32). In other words, we were
// unable to write a function that stashed a reference in a global variable without reflecting that
// intention in the function’s signature. In Rust, a function’s signature always exposes the body’s
// behavior.
//
// Conversely, if we do see a function with a signature like g(p: &i32) (or with the lifetimes
// written out, g<'a>(p: &'a i32)), we can tell that it does not stash its argument p anywhere that
// will outlive the call. There’s no need to look into g’s definition; the signature alone tells us

// lifetimes may overlap with a mutable reference are those you borrow from the mutable reference
